Thanks for purchasing TOON Deserted Temples!

A few easy steps are required in order to ensure proper function of the pack.

	1. Please make sure you install the proper version in your Unity Project. At the moment, only Built-in (2021.3.0 and later) and URP (2021.3.0 and later) are supported.

	2. Depending on the Unity version, the Color Space might be set to "Gamma" by default. Make sure you set it to "Linear", in order for the lighting to function properly.
You can find the Color Space setting in: "Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Rendering"

	3. Make sure to check the "Opaque Texture" option box in the "Universal Render Pipeline Asset" that you're using in your project.
You can find it in the "Assets > Settings" folder. This is required for the water shader to function with full features.
