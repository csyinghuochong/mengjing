SETTING-UP THE PROJECT:

Built-in RP:
1. Install the Post Processing package from Package Manager
2. Set Color Space to Linear (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings)

URP:
1. Set Color Space to Linear (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings)
2. Go to the "URP Shaders" folder and unpack a URP package, depending on your editor version
3. Set the "Highlands Universal Render Pipeline Asset" as default or keep your own (Edit > Project Setiings > Graphics > Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings)
