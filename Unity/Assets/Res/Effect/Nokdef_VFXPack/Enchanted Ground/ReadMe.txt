QUICK START
-----------
The default rendering version on this package is HDRP. If you want to upgrade for either URP or Standard rendering pipeline, you may do so by importing the provided unity packages inside the folder "Assets\Nokdef_VFXPack\Enchanted Ground"

Once you have the right rendering pipeline selected, you can simply choose a particle system inside of the "Assets\Nokdef_VFXPack\Enchanted Ground" folder and drag it into the scene.
